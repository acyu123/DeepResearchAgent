## 2. Warren Buffett's Investment Philosophy

### 2.1 Value Investing and Intrinsic Value
Warren Buffett's core philosophy is rooted in value investing inspired by Benjamin Graham, emphasizing buying companies at a price below their intrinsic value with a margin of safety [3]. Investment decisions are based on intrinsic valuation, where a company’s real worth exceeds its market price, providing a cushion against errors and fluctuations.

### 2.2 Long-Term Holding and Compound Growth
Buffett advocates for holding investments over the long term to benefit from compound growth. He discourages reacting to short-term market movements, highlighting patience as a key virtue [3][4]. His investment holdings, such as Coca-Cola and Apple, exemplify this long-term, high-conviction approach [3].

### 2.3 Focus on Quality and Economic Moats
Investments should focus on companies with strong brands, distinct products, and economic moats that prevent competitors from eroding profits [3]. High profit margins, low debt ratios, increasing revenues, and reinvested earnings further delineate his criteria for choosing stocks [3].

### 2.4 Reinvestment and Share Repurchases
Buffett prefers companies that reinvest profits to foster growth and prioritize share repurchases over issuing new shares, thus enhancing EPS and shareholder value [3]. He emphasizes understanding businesses thoroughly—an ability often summarized as evaluating within five minutes for simple, understandable businesses.

### 2.5 Patience and Market Perspective
He underscores patience as a critical virtue, often quoting that the stock market transfers wealth from the impatient to the patient investors [4]. Buffett recommends low-cost index funds for passive investors, emphasizing the importance of long-term, steady growth [4].

### 3.2 Independence and Intellectual Humility
A key insight from Munger is the importance of independent judgment and recognizing personal limitations—what one doesn’t know—highlighting intellectual humility as vital to successful investing [5]. This cautious approach aims to avoid biases and irrational decision-making.

### 3.3 Concentrated, High-Quality Opportunities
Munger favors a concentrated portfolio of high-quality, often expensive, but fundamentally superior companies. He believes in buying "wonderful businesses" at fair prices and holding them long-term, aligning with Buffett’s core but emphasizing fewer, more selected, high-quality picks [5].

### 3.4 Limited Diversification
Contrary to common practice, Munger asserts that over-diversification dilutes the impact of good ideas. He advocates for fewer, well-chosen investments based on rigorous analysis, allowing investors to capitalize more effectively on their best opportunities [5].

### 3.5 Mental Models and Simplicity
Inverting thinking and applying mental models—such as thinking about what could go wrong—are central to Munger’s strategy. He urges maintaining focus and simplicity, avoiding unnecessary complexity that clouds judgment [6].

### 3.6 Capital Allocation and Patience
